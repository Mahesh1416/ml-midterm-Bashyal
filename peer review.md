### Peer Review: Titanic Survial Dataset:
# Classification Machine Learning Midterm
#Notebook Link: https://github.com/nwn8/applied-ml-nates/blob/main/notebooks/Midterm/classification_NathanSloss.ipynb
___

1. Clarity and Organization
The notebook is very well-structured and is numbered properly. The visuals are appropriate and well labelled. Overall, the steps such as data import, exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training and evaluation were done very well. 

___


2. Feature Selection and Justification
Nathan created a new feature called "aggregate" where Nathan added different features such as Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Age and Fare. Moreover, a new feature was added called "Agg_squared" to suqre the aggregate number for normalization. 

___

4. Model Performance and Comparisons
Nathan used Decision Tree Model and SVC model for predicting passenger survival in the Titanic Dataset. Nathan added in his reflections that SVC did not do any better than Decision Tree model and Passenger class was the best predictor for survival which was also confirmed later when Nathan used Neural network model for prediction. 

___


6. Reflection Quality
Overall, Nathan did a good job in summarizing the major findings. They have also effectivley highlighted their findings and added conclusions throughout the reflection sections in their notebook.
